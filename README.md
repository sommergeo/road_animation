# road_animation
 This repo provides tools for the animation of <a href="http://www.roceeh.uni-tuebingen.de/roadweb/smarty_road_simple_search.php" target="_blank">ROAD</a> content in space and time. The ROCEEH out of Africa Database (ROAD) is assembled since 2008 by the <a href="http://www.roceeh.net" target="_blank">ROCEEH</a> and serves information from Africa and Eurasia between ~3 Ma and ~20 ka. 


 
 ## Content
 - <a href="/lithics" target="_blank">Occurence of lithic tools</a> over the past 3 Ma 
 - <a href="/input" target="_blank">Growth of the ROAD database</a> since 2009 animated by the first creation of assemblages
 
## Example
This animation shows the occurence of lithic tools between 3 Ma and recent. Red dots indicate human occupation of archaeological sites at the respective time-slice (based on assemblage dates). Black dots mark abandoned sites. Since evidence is rather sparse in the first ~1.5 Ma, the animation runs fast in the beginning and becomes exponentially slower. 
We used a <a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/maplibrary/the-robinson-projection/" target="_blank">Robinson projection</a> centered around 50Â°E to show a suitable trade-off between level of distortion and visual appeal.
